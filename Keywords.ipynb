    " In Python, identifiers are names given to various program elements such as variables, functions, classes, modules, etc. Here are the rules for defining identifiers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Valid Characters: Identifiers can consist of letters (both lowercase and uppercase), digits, and underscore (_). However, they cannot begin with a digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Case Sensitivity: Python identifiers are case-sensitive, meaning uppercase and lowercase letters are distinct. For example, var and Var are different identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reserved Words: Identifiers cannot be the same as Python keywords or reserved words, as they have predefined meanings in the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Length: Identifiers can be of any length, but it is recommended to keep them concise and descriptive for better readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cannot Start with Digits: Identifiers cannot start with a digit but can have digits in other positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conventions: It is a convention in Python to use lowercase letters for variable names and lowercase letters separated by underscores for function and method names (snake_case). For class names, it is recommended to use CamelCase.\n",
