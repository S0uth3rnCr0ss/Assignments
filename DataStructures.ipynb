    "Ans. The primary difference between dictionaries and lists in Python is their structure and how they store data. Lists are ordered collections accessed by index, while dictionaries are unordered collections accessed by keys. Lists are suited for ordered data storage, whereas dictionaries excel in key-based data access. This difference impacts their use cases: lists are used for sequential data, and dictionaries are used for key-value mapping and efficient data retrieval.\n",
